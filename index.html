                survive in all climates!

                    <li>Planning - Before beginning the project, we planned what the project would be about and its story. 
                    With this we had a clear idea of the structure of the project, what it would need and where.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Communication - All members kept in constant communication periodically, to either update about the progress that has been made about the work or to lend aid to the other in solving a problem. 
                    This leaded to effective time management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Task Management - The tasks were distributed evenly amongst the group members. 
                    At times member would then delegate to the tasks that they were most comfortable with or a better understanding of how it would work. 
                    After the main body or structure of the game was developed, further detail was then added to further refine the game all while carrying out tests for any bugs or errors.
